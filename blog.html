            <h2><u>THE BIG FIVE</u></h2>
            <div class="article">
                <p>
                    The term "Big Five" is commonly used in the context of African wildlife to refer to the five most
                    iconic and recognizable animals found in the continent's savannas and grasslands.
                    These animals are:<br>
                
                    1.African Elephant<br>
                    2.African Buffalo<br>
                    3.African Lion<br>
                    4.African Leopard<br>
                    5.Black Rhinoceros
              </p>
                <p>
                    These animals are called the "Big Five" because they were historically the most difficult and
                    dangerous animals to hunt on foot in Africa, due to their size, power, and unpredictable
                    behavior.<br>
                    Today, the term is often used in a more positive context to refer to the five most iconic and
                    sought-after animals for wildlife viewing and photography in African national parks and reserves.
